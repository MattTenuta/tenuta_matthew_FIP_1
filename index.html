                    Port Glasgow is a small community right on the edge of Lake Erie and is the only 
                    marina in the area. There are trailer parks and camping grounds that overlook 
                    the lake where you can create new family memories or make new friends. This 
                    gem will soon be home to a new condominium and retail development, creating new 
                    places for people to live, job opportunities, shop and enjoy life right on the water.  
                    Port Glasgow Marina and Beach is a great place to grab an ice cream, play on the 
                    beach, go fishing, take the boat out or enjoy a sunset or sunrise with a loved one! </p>

                        your lucky day because in Rodney you can find Ye Old Jail which is the smallest jail in 
                        North America. Built in 1890, it is a mere 14.76 feet by 17.71 feet. After being 
                        vacant for about 50 years, it was reopened as a tourist attraction in 1995 and still has 
                        the original cell doors and stove inside. This historic part of Canada can be found at 
                        135 Queen Street, Rodney ON if you want to experience it for yourself.  </p>
